No project is perfect so I have come up with a list of improvements and also took note of possible bugs in this dashboard

## Improvements

### UI

1.  Add a background color that does not clash with the dark theme

    1.  Possibly add a darkmode toggle

2.  Add background cards to better visualize separation between plots

3.  Add the possibility to show all communities in the United States when 'All' is selected in States and revert to top 10 when a State is selected

### New Graphs

1.  Add a radar graph or donut chart to show community demographic composition

2.  Add a choropleth

3.  Add 3D capabilities

4.  Add a downloadable data table

## Bugs

1.  The UI is not rendering double columns as programmed in the code

# Crime does not pay

Link to live dashboard:

## Motivation

Crime is a matter that affects everyone, and can have serious repercussions on how a community develops and interacts. What causes crime and how a community responds is a very controversial topic rife with misinformation and assumptions. That is why I aimed to create a visualization dashboard to allow everybody to explore a few important features and crime statistics collected by the FBI's UCR division in the year 1995. In this dashboard I aspire to give insight into how violent crime can be related to income, population, poverty and unemployment. These features appear in almost every crime report and I hope that by exploring this small dataset people can reflect on how these features change among different communities in the United States of America.

## Description of the Dashboard

This is an interactive visualization tool that reacts to the user's selections in the dropboxes.

The landing page consists of a Heat Map that shows the selected feature (by default Violent Crime Rate) by State (or by default All the Continental US and Alaska)
